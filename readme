Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

I thought that the first two parts of the assignment were helpful and I
learned a good amount. Those parts were also enjoyable. However, I felt
like part 3 was a lot of busywork after the initial planning.

Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

ft.c: (in function FT_traversePath)
ft.c:95:42: Variable ulChildID used before definition
  An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some execution
  path. (Use -usedef to inhibit warning)
ft.c: (in function FT_getFileContents)
ft.c:432:27: Variable oNNode used before definition
ft.c: (in function FT_replaceFileContents)
ft.c:451:36: Variable oNNode used before definition
ft.c: (in function FT_stat)
ft.c:472:30: Variable oNNode used before definition

All the above errors are caused because the variables are passed by 
reference and initialized by another function. These function calls have 
a status check to ensure the function succeeded. Since the functions
succeeded, it is safe to assume that the variables are initialized.

There are lots of errors about how a function is declared but not 
defined. These errors are not accurate since they are defined in the .c
files. However, critTer does not appear to be able to access the .c
files, it is only accessing the .h files with the declarations.
The files are:
path.h
nodeFT.h
dynarray.h

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

   ft.c: line 185: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?

FT_insertNode could insert a file with NULL contents. Therefore, it is
ok for pvContents to be NULL. If FT_insertNode is inserting a directory,
it does not check pvContents at all, so it is ok for pvContents to be 
NULL in that case too.

   ft.c: line 380: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?

FT_insertFile could be called with pvContents NULL since a file can have
NULL contents. Therefore, it is ok for pvContents to be NULL.

   ft.c: line 437: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?

FT_replaceFileContents could be called with pvContents NULL since a file
can have NULL contents. Therefore, it is ok for pvContents to be NULL.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1        
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2        
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3        
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4        
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5        
===============================================================

What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?
